		<h2>About me...</h2>
		<p>
			I am a high-school retro computing enthusiast, and I wish to share my experience and joy with everyone...
			In 2017, I got interested in computer hardware. Since then, I frequently visited local computer stores
			and e-waste recyclers to collect vintage computer hardwares. Now I actually got plenty of them! In the
			past few years, many people had helped me and taught me lots of useful knowledge. Huge thanks to them!
			If you want to get in touch with me, please read the "Contact me..." section down below.
